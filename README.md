# MY BACKGROUND AND INTERESTS

Dr. Lee serves as part of the Data Analytics faculty at Miami Dade College (MDC) School of Engineering and Technology (EnTech).  In this capacity, he teaches several Data Analytics courses and serves the college through various committees. 

Dr. Lee's philosophy of education is that all students are unique and must have a stimulating educational environment where they can grow as a person. It is this desire to create an inclusive atmosphere where all students can safely and confidently share their ideas, take risks, and ultimately meet their full potential.  Dr. Lee is a strong believer that a diverse, equitable, and inclusive classroom is a strength.

"I believe that there are five essential elements that are conducive to learning.

(1) The professor's role is to act as a guide.

(2) Students must have access to hands-on activities.

(3) Students should be able to have choices and let their curiosity direct their learning.

(4) Students need the opportunity to practice skills in a safe environment.

(5) Although technology is integral to the learning process, the focus is on teaching skills (Teach the student but use Data Analytics as the tool)"

 

Dr. Lee's 30 years of industry experience includes, but is not limited to, roles such as Lead Research Scientist, Lead Data Scientist, Sr. Data Analyst, Blockchain Architect, Cloud Engineer, and Enterprise Architect.  His primary areas of expertise are as follows:
